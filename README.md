# The Expert at the Card Table

## Introduction

I have created this project to share in a more modern form the classic on cards manipulation: **The Expert at the Card Table** by **S.W. Erdnase**.

The first step of the project will be to re-write the content of the book using Markdown.  
The second step of the project will be to generate this content in a mobile-first approach.  
Then I would love to re-publish the book, with a modern touch in layout and calligraphy - not in content - but that is for later :)
