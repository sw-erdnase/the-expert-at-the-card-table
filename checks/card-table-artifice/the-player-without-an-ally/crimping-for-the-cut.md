# Crimping for the Cut

THE probability of the unsuspecting player cutting into a crimp is always kept in view. The process of crimping is fully explained under caption â€œIndicating Location For The Cut" When crimping for the chance of the cut being made at that point, the bend is put in more forcibly, and sometimes if the company is not too fast, the two packets may be crimped in opposite directions, creating quite a space and thereby increasing the probabilities of the player unconsciously cutting into it. The packets may be crimped concave, or convex, as thought best for the player's mode of cutting, but the deck should be squared up perfectly and laid down accordingly. It is the rule for players to cut in about the same manner each time. That is, he cuts high, low or near the middle, and seizes the cards by the sides or ends. The mode of cutting oftentimes becomes a habit that is unconsciously followed. The observant dealer is thus enabled to put in his crimp high or low, in about the location most favorable, and concave if the player cuts by the ends, and convex if at the sides. The deck must be laid down so that the hand which the player habitually uses will come naturally into the most favorable position to oblige the dealer. Even if the crimp is missed it still locates the stock, and the dealer has other opportunities of profiting thereby. Of course crimped cards are never dealt. The crimp is effectually taken out by bending in the opposite direction.
