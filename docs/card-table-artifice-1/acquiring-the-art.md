# Acquiring the Art

To attain the highest degree of excellence at card manipulation much study and practice are necessary; but proficiency in the art quite sufficient for the purpose of entertainment or amusement may be acquired with very little effort if a thorough understanding is first obtained of the best and simplest methods of accomplishing sleights. The only proper way to practice is to be seated in the usual manner at a card table with a looking glass opposite; and much time and labor are saved by this plan. The correct positions and movements can be accurately secured, and the performer becomes his own critic.

The beginner invariably imagines his hands are too small or too large, but the size has little to do with the possibilities of skill. Soft; moderately moist hands are best adapter for the purpose. When the cuticle is hard and dry, or excessively humid, the difficulties increase. A simple preparation to soften the hands and good general health usually produce the desired conditions. Of course dry fingers may be moistened, or damp ones dried, but either operation is objectionable.

For superior work the cards should be new, thin, flexible and of best quality. Cheap cards are clumsy and not highly finished. Cards that have been handled two or three hours become more or less sticky, and the slightest friction is a detriment to perfect manipulation.
