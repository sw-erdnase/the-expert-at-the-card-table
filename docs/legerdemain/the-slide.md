# The Slide

Hold the deck in the left hand, back to palm, fingers and thumb at opposite sides. Show face of deck to company, then turn it down, and with tips of third and little fingers slide the bottom card half an inch or so towards wrist (see Fig. 97), and draw the next card out at end with right hand fingers. Of course this has the appearance of drawing off the card just shown to the company.

It is a form of exchange that may be occasionally employed.
