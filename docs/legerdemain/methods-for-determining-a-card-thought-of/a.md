# A

Hold the deck in the left hand, thumb across top near inner end, and first and second fingers at side. Bring over the right hand and seize deck with fingers at outer ends, thumb at inner end, and hold so that the outer ends of the cards may be sprung or "ruffled," with the faces towards the spectator. Requesting him to think of a card, spring the ends rapidly, stopping for an instant at any one place (see Fig. 95), then completing the ruffle. The springing is performed at such a pace that the spectator can recognize but one card, which is more fully exposed by the momentary lull in the springing, and at this point the performer forms and holds a break with the end of left second finger. At the end of the first ruffle ask if card has been noted, and if not repeat the action, but of course hesitating at some other point.
