Hold the deck acros the left palm face down, extend it towards a spectator, requesting him to think of one of them. As he cannot see any he will naturally attempt to take the deck in his hands, or cut off a portion. In either case let him cut only, and the moment he sees the bottom card of his packet thank hum and take back the cut, holding a break at the location.
