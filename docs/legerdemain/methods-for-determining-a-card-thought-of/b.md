Hold the deck lenghtwise in the right hand, face to palm, between second joint of thumb and ends of fingers. Bend finger end downwards and allow ends to escape rapidly, springing them into the left hand in the usual manner of the flourish. Hesitate, or stop the springing for an instant, at any stage of the operation \(see Fig. 96\), and the only card that the performer can notice or fairly distinguish will be the probable selection of the spectator. Of course the performer conceals his notice of the cards as far as possible.
