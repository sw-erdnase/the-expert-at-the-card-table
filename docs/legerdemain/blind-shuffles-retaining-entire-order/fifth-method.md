# Fifth Method

This process is very much employed by many clever card conjurers who ought to know better, and we include it only because it is in common use and to suggest its rejection. It consists of pushing small packets alternately from the top and bottom of the portion held in one hand to the bottom and top of the portion held in the other.

The deck is held in the left hand and several cards are pushed over by the left thumb into the right hand. Then the left fingers push several cards from the bottom on top of the right hand cards. Then the left thumb again pushes several from the top, but there are received under the right hand portion. The left fingers now push several from the top to the top of the right hand portion, and so on until the left hand is empty.

This clumsy juggling might prove satisfactory if performed by an awkward novice before a parcel of school children, but it appears simply ridiculous in the hands of a card conjurer, who, it is presumed, knows how to shuffle a deck in the customary manner, and with at least the degree of smoothness that any ordinary person might possess.
