# Palming

In addition to the methods given in the first part of our book, which we consider the best for general purposes, we shall describe several processes that may be employed advantageously under special circumstances.

The top cards may be palmed apparently without touching the deck in the following manner: Hold the deck across the left palm, the little finger well inserted under the cards to be palmed, the first, second and third fingers holding the cards firmly in place. Now move the right hand, through some natural motive, over the left, and as it passes within one inch or two straighten out the left-hand fingers, forcing the cards up into the right palm with the little finger, which is under them. The right hand either continues its movement as it slightly closes over the palmed cards or else seizes the deck in a manner to expose it fully, and the left hand makes some gesture or natural movement.

A simple way to palm one top card is to push it slightly over the side under cover of the right hand, then press down on the side under cover of the right hand, then press down on its outer-end corner with the right little finger-tip, and it will spring up into the right palm.

In all cases of palming the deck should be covered for the smallest possible space of time, and the covering and exposing should be made under some natural pretext, such as squaring up the cards, or passing the deck to the other hand, or changing its position in the hand, or turning it over.
