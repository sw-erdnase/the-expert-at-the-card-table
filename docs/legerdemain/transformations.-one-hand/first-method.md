# First Method

Hold the deck in the left hand, the thumb well extended across the face, first finger at end, second finger and little fingers at side and third finger curled in as far as possible underneath. Grip the top card with the thumb and draw it back, tilting up the deck with the third finger until the top card clears the side \(see Fig. 89\), then press the top card down between the curled-up finger and deck by bringing the thumb again to its original position across top. \(See Fig. 90.\) The third and little fingerends steady the pack as it is tilted upward, but the first finger takes no part in the action. The top card must be gripped well into the root of the thumb and drawn back as far as possible as the deck is being tilted up.

The action should be covered by a swing, and as it is extremely difficult to execute without some noise the company might be informed that if they cannot see the "transformation" they will be permitted to hear it. The rapidity of the action is proportionate to the skill of the performer, and it may be made with the hand in any position.
