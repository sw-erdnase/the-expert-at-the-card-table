# Transformations. Two Hands

The card conjurer in many instances purposely produces the wrong card, and when his error \(?\) is proclaimed by the company or the individual, he coolly proposes to "make good" by transforming the wrong card into the right one. This is usually done by placing the wrong card on the top or bottom of the deck and making the "transformation" with the aid of both hands or only one.
