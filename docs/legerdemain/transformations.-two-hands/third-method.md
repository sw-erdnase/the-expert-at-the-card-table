# Third Method

Hold the deck in left hand, resting on its side across the third joints of the four fingers, tip of thumb on top side, face to the company. Cover face with the right hand held quite flatly; tilt top side of deck slightly toward right hand; drop left thumb to the back, and push up the top card. As it comes above the side bring the right hand up and back over the left thumb, catching the up-coming card against the side of the hand and palming it as it is carried over, the left thumb aiding the palming by pressing the card home. The left thumb then instantly retakes its position on the top side of the deck. The movement of the right hand is made apparently to show the bottom card. The right hand now covers the deck for an instant, leaving the palmed card there.

Palming the back card in this manner may be done very rapidly, but a slow movement is satisfactory.
