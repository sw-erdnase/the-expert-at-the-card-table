# Second Method

Hold the deck in the left hand, between the thumb and second, third and little fingers, at sides, first fingertip against the back near end, and the back, or top card, the selected card; the wrong card being on the bottom, or placed there and held in full view. To make the transformation bring the right hand over the deck with the four fingertips against the end. Slide or push the selected card with the first finger up against the right-hand finger ends, drawing the deck down toward the wrist until it clears the lower end of the selected card, which is pressed into the right palm by the left first finger. \(See Fig. 85.\) Then slide the deck back to its first position. This sleight may be made in an instant and the action is fully covered.
