# Fifth Method

Hold the deck in the left hand, thumb and three fingers at opposites sides, first finger against the end. Cover the deck with the right hand but run the right thumb underneath. Now draw out the under card with the right thumb, palming it, and again cover the deck, leaving the palmed card on top.
