# Fourth Method

The action of this transformation is identical with the Third Method, but the first and little fingers are held against the end of the deck close to the lower corners, the thumb and second and third fingers at the top and bottom sides as before. In this position the deck is held much more firmly, and it becomes easier for the left thumb to push up one card at a time, the fingers at the ends restraining the other cards. The right hand performs its part as in the Third Method. The improvement is our own. (See Fig. 86.)
