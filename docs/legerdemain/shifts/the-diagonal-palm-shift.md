# The Diagonal Palm-Shift

The plan of having one or several selected cards inserted in the deck, then forcing them through slightly diagonally, and twisting them out to the top or bottom, is well known to most conjurers, and by some is treated as a blind shuffle. That the process is not satisfactory is seen by the fact that it is seldom or never employed, and but rarely even mentioned in any list of card slights. Our efforts to improve, or rather to combine the first part of this manoeuvre with a process for palming the inserted cards, instead of placing them on top or bottom of the deck, is shown in the following description. The action is silent, rapid, undetectable if well performed, and takes place under the ordinary movement of passing the deck to be shuffled.

Hold the deck in the left hand, by sides, between the first joints of thumb, and second, third and little fingers, first finger curled up at bottom. Allow spectator to insert selected card in outer end of deck, pushing it in until about half an inch only protrudes. Now bring the right hand over deck with the little finger at side corner of protruding card, second and third fingers at middle of end, and first finger close to end corner, and the thumb close to the inner end corner of the deck. Apparently push the card straight home, but really push the protruding end with the right little finger, about quarter of an inch to the left, so that the right first finger can push the tilted corner down the side of the deck, the card moving slightly diagonally, and the opposite corner just grazing the right thumb, and protruding about three-quarters of an inch. The left third and little fingers are released sufficiently to allow the card to protrude at the side. The left thumb now takes the place of the right first finger, pushing the corner flush with side of deck. \(See Fig. 74.\)

The diagonal position of the selected card is now perfectly concealed, and the deck is held in a natural and regular manner. A little practice at the diagonal slide enables one to get the card in that position instantaneously. The next action is to palm the selected card in the left hand, as the right passes the deck to be shuffled.

With the left little finger against the side of card, swing or turn it inwards, using the right thumb as a pivot, straighten out left first, second, and third fingers, catching the outer end as it turns, and at the same time sliding pack outwards and to the right, the left hand turning over and inwards with the palmed card \(see Fig. 75\) and the little finger slipped to the end.

There should be no force or twist employed, the card running out as freely as though drawn. The card and the deck must continue on the same plane until quite free of each other. The left little finger may press the side of the card very slightly upwards, so that as it is palmed it will bend into instead of away from the left hand. As the card is being turned by the little finger the left thumb is raised, letting the right thumb with the corner of deck pass under it, so that the card can lie parallel with, but still above, the left palm. As the deck is slid out, the right thumb slides along the side of the card, and it is not actually palmed until the hands are almost free of each other.

The whole action may be made quick as a flash and without a sound, yet when performed quite slowly is still a perfect blind. The left hand may seize the deck by the corner, between the first finger and thumb, as the card is palmed, leaving the right hand free \(see Fig. 76\); but the beauty of the shift is in the natural and simple manner of palming the selected card, by the ordinary movement the right hand makes in passing the deck to be shuffled.

We wish to particularly impress our readers with the merits of this palm-shift. It is not difficult if a proper understanding of the action is obtained, and it is of very great assistance in card tricks. It dispenses to a great extent with the regular shifts and blind shuffles, and it can be accomplished under the very nose of a shrewd spectator without an inkling of what is taking place. The usual procedure of card-handlers is to insert the little finger over the selected card, shift the two packets and palm the card from the top in the right hand. This process takes more time, the shift must be concealed by a partial turn, swing or drop of the hands; and to palm, the deck must be covered at least for an instant. In the palm-shift described the card is placed in its diagonal position with apparently the customary movement of squaring up, and the rest is accomplished, as it were, by handling the deck to be shuffled.

Several cards may be palmed together, when inserted at different points, or from one point, or from top, or bottom. If the top card is to be shifted, it is slipped into the same diagonal position and held in place by the right little finger being curled up on top. The action is the same. When the single card palm-shift is acquired, the rest will come easily.
