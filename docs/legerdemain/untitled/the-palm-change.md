# The Palm Change

In this process an entirely different subterfuge is employed, and it is probably the most ingenious ever devised for the purpose.

The two cards to be exchanged are held in the right hand by the ends between the second and third fingertips and the thumb, and close together, so that when shown to the company thew appear as one. The right hand is now turned palm down and the left hand apparently takes the card that was exposed, laying it on the table, but in reality takes the second card, leaving the other one palmed in the right hand. This is done by seizing both cards between the left thumb and second and third fingers, and drawing out the upper one with the thumb and pressing the lower one up into the right palm with the left fingers as the top one is drawn off. \(See Fig. 82.\)

This change is one of the simplest and easiest feats in the whole range of card slights, and yet one of the most useful and undetectable. The action should be performed in about the same time and manner that would ordinary be taken in transferring a card from one hand to the other.
