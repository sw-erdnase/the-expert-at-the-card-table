# Leaving Selected Card in Hand of Spectator

A plan for the production of a single card, as the last of a series, is to bring it to the bottom face up and request the spectator to hold the deck firmly by the corner, thumb on top. By striking the deck forcibly from above all the cards will fall from his hand save the selected card, which is retained by the friction of the fingers and left face up in his hand.
