# Cards Raising from the Hand

The selected cards are brought to top of deck and the pack is held in the left hand, thumb at one side and lying straight along with tip near end, second third and little fingers at opposite side, and first finger at back. The cards are pushed up by first finger, the thumb and other fingers being released sufficiently to allow their rising, but retaining their position. (See Fig. 98.) When the cards are raised to nearly the full length the right hand takes them off. Some address is necessary to push up a card with one finger, but a little practice, and especially at the manner of holding the deck, so as to keep the card in position and yet not retard its upward course, will soon acquire the ability. If the first and second fingers are placed at the back the feat becomes much easier, but of course the effect is proportionately lessened.
