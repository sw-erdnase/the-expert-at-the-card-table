# Blind Shuffles

The objects of blind shuffling are to retain a top stock, i. e., to retain the same order the upper portion of the deck which has been prearranged for dealing; or to retain a bottom stock, which usually consists of certain desired cards placed together at the bottom, to be taken from that position at will, during the deal, by bottom dealing; or to retain the whole deck in a certain order, which is rarely attempted, though quite possible. Under the respective headings of "Stocking," and "Culling," it will be learned how the blind shuffle runs up the cards in any desired order, and gathers certain cards from any position to the bottom; but the several methods of retaining the top and bottom stocks are treated separately.
