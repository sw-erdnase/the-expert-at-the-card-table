# II. This is located by the jog

When using the hand-shuffle change the position slightly so that the four fingers will lie flatly against the bottom of the deck. Make the extra under cut and bring tips of the second and third left fingers against and slightly above packet remaining in left hand. In throwing the right-hand packet on top, let it slide a little across the left finger tips, so that a jog is made by the bottom card or cards, which are prevented from going completely over. \(See Fig. 21.\) This is perfectly hidden by the right hand. Square up the deck by the ends only and lay down to be cut, thereby not disturbing the jog. The ally cuts with the left hand, seizing the upper packet by the sides, the left thumb easily and instantaneously locating the jog by touch.

The action of both players must be rapid and careless in appearance, but not hurried. The irregularity of the side edges made necessary by the jog does not attract attention or expose the ruse, as in ordinary play the deck is rarely perfectly square when given to cut.
