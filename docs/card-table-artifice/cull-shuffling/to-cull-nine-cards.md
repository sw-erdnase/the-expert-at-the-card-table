# To Cull Nine Cards, Numbers 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 7, 1

Under-cut about one-third deck, in-jog first card and shuffle off. Under-cut to in-jog and run one less than first number, in-jog running all cards to and including last card of second set. \(This run is nine, four in first set, two indifferent cards, three in second set.\) Out-jog running one less than next number \(six\), and throw on top. \(This places first two sets at top and bottom of middle packet, and third set on top.\) Under-cut to out-jog, forming break at in-jog, in-jog top card, run second set \(three\) throw to break and shuffle off. \(All the desired cards are now together, but the in-jog divides the last two.\) Under-cut to in-jog and throw on top. This leaves one card on top and eight on bottom.

This example might well be termed a fancy cull, as running down so many cards will rarely be attempted, but it shows the possibilities of the system. Before the shuffle is begun the entire action should be mentally rehearsed so that there will be no hesitation in the procedure.

There is no difficult sleight-of-hand manipulation connected with the operation. Any one who can shuffle can cull, if he has the understanding. Rapidity is not nearly so important as regularity of time and movement.

There are many ways of making the cull shuffle more simple. The dealer can gather up the cards with a great deal of judgment yet without apparent design. He will never face a card or cards, or never change the positions in any group, but he can pick up any card or group of cards in the order best suited to his design without attracting attention. He can note the order the cards fall, in any particular trick, how many cards or tricks have been thrown on top of those he desires, the order of any discard exposed, his own discard, and the last cards played on the table. There are scores of opportunities to note the order of desirable cards in any game. If the dealer has an ally the two may work together in gathering up the cards, and the possibilities are doubled.

When the desired cards are run down to the bottom the dealer could continue the shuffle and run up a top stock, but the time required for the two operations would be too long. The usual practice is to deal from the bottom. Fifteen or twenty seconds is plenty of time to execute a three-card cull shuffle, and it can be done in half the time.
