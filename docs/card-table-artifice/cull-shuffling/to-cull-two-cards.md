# To Cull Two Cards, Numbers 8, 4

Under-cut about half deck, in-jog first card and shuffle off. Under-cut to in-jog, run one less than first number, in-jog, running one more than second number, out-jog and shuffle off. \(The two desired cards are now located at top and bottom of the middle packet, which is held by the in and out-jogs.\) Under-cut to out-jog, forming break at in-jog, in-jog first card \(a desired card\), throw to break, and shuffle off. \(The two desired cards are now together, being the in-jog card and the next above it.\) Under-cut to in-jog and shuffle off. This leaves the two desired cards at the bottom.

The action is a little confusing at first, but when this system of culling is understood it becomes very simple. The first under-cut and shuffle-off, in the foregoing example, has no bearing on the result, but it places the cards to be worked on well down in the deck, and this aids in making the whole shuffle appear regular.
