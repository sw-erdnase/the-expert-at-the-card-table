# To Cull Four Cards, Numbers 3, 6, 2, 5

Under-cut about one third deck, in-jog first card and shuffle off. Under-cut to in-jog, run one less than first number, in-jog running one more than second number, out-jog running one less than third number, and throw on top. \(Two of the cards are now at top and bottom of middle packet,  one on top of deck, and the last at its original number from top card.\) Under-cut to out-jog, forming break at in-jog, in-jog top card, run one, throw to break and shuffle off. \(Three cards are now together at in-jog, and last card at its number below in-jog\) Under-cut to in-jog and run one less than last number and throw on top. \(Three of the cards are now at the bottom, the fourth on top.\)

The top card can now be brought to the bottom with its fellows by an under-cut to top card and a throw on top; or, under-cut about half deck, in-jog top card, and throw on top; then under-cut to in-jog and shuffle off.

To under-cut to top card and throw on top, or, in other worlds, to run one and throw balance on top, if done rapidly, appears like a simple cut, and the fact that but one card is taken from the top to the bottom cannot be detected.

These examples of culling, if fairly well executed, have all the appearance of an ordinary shuffle, and when performed with the smoothness and grace of a clever card handler it is absolutely impossible to detect the least manipulation.

It will be noticed in the examples given that culling is largely a repetition of the same actions, as the number to be culled increase; and consequently the time required is greater. But should the desired cards run together in pairs, or threes or more, the action and time are shortened proportionately. Sets of cards running together are treated much as though each set were one card. If the order be 6, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, the action of getting them all together will be mush the same as though they were but two cards at 6, 4. If the order were 5, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 7, 1, the action would be about the same as a three-card cull shuffle, though there are nine desired cards actually run down to the bottom.
