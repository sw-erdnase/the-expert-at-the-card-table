# To Cull Three Cards, Numbers 7, 5, 9

Under-cut about half deck, in-jog first card and shuffle off. Under-cut to in-jog, run one less than first number, in-jog running one more than second number, out-jog running one less than third number, and throw on top. \(Two of the desired cards are now at top and bottom of middle packet and the third on top of the deck.\) Under-cut to out-jog, forming break at in-jog, in-jog top card, run one, throw to break and shuffle off. \(The three cards are now together at in-jog.\) Under-cut to in-jog, and shuffle off, leaving the three desired cards at the bottom.

It is necessary to put some little brains into so simple a problem as adding two and two together, and to become accomplished at culling one must have an understanding of the cause and effect of the various actions. It is impossible to give a formula that will answer for every situation. There is no end to the variety of positions the desired cards may be in. But with a thorough knowledge of the two examples given, and the reason for each particuar action, the student will be fairly established on the road to success, and have overcome by far the greatest difficulty.
