Seize the deck at sides, near ends, between finger and thumb of each hand. Draw out about one-third of deck from bottom with right second finger and thumb, and place on top but retain hold. Then hook up about half of the under part, with the third finger and thumb of right hand, and raise the whole deck from the table with both hands. Now suddenly draw out the middle packet with the right second finger and thumb , the lower packet with the left second finger and thumb, and release the top packet with the right second finger, which will allow it to fall on the table. (See Fig. 14.) Drop the left hand packet on top, and then the right packet.

We have elaborated upon this cut, and the following formula for a four throw blind is the outcome:
