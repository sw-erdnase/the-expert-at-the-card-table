# III. To Retain the Bottom Stock and Shuffle Whole Deck

Under cut about three-quarters of the deck and shuffle off about two-thirds, then in-jog one card and throw balance on top. Under cut to and include in-jog card \(see Fig. 4\), and shuffle off.

This blind retains the bottom stock and apparently shuffles the whole deck. The only difficulty in the action is in including the jog card in the second under cut. The jog card is pulled back by the thumb, creating a space above it; then as the under cut is made, the thumb tip is pressed into the opening by squeezing the ends of the under packet, and the upper packet is not disturbed, because the thumb nail slips easily across the card above it as the lower packet is drawn out.

When a jog is formed during the process of any shuffle, and the right hand is shifted a little in or out as the case may be, to allow the jog card to fall in the proper place, the right hand dos not at once return to its former position, but gradually works back as the shuffle progresses. This leaves the cards in the left hand a little irregular at the ends, and effectually conceals the fact that any one card is purposely protruding. The ablest shuffler cannot keep his quite even, and the irregularity appears even more natural than if in perfect order.

A blind shuffles for retaining the whole deck in its original order are never practiced at the card table, and are only adapted to conjuring purposes, the methods will be found full explained in the second part of this work.

The foregoing shuffles are simple and easy, and when perfectly performed, absolutely indistinguishable from the true.
